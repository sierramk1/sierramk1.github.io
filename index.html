      <div class="text-content">
        <p>I am a first-year master’s student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I completed my undergraduate degree at Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science and discovered my passion for data analysis and statistics.</p>
        <p>I am grateful to be continuing my education at Michigan, where I am building a strong theoretical foundation in statistics while applying my technical skills to real-world projects. I enjoy using analytical and collaborative approaches to tackle interesting problems and am always eager to keep learning and improving.</p>
        <p>My current interests include computational statistics, AI/ML, Bayesian statistics, survival analysis, clinical trials, and big data health analytics. Outside of academics, I enjoy running, true crime novels, live music, and podcasts.</p>

    <p>I have experience with several programming languages and tools, and I enjoy learning new ones.
  I have over two years of experience in <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Java</span> and <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Python</span>, including work with Python's <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Pandas</span> library for data
  manipulation and analysis. In data analysis, I have utilized <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">R</span>, <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">SAS</span>, <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Alteryx</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">SQL</span> to extract insights from complex
  datasets and create comprehensive reports. I have also worked with data visualization and analytics platforms such as <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Apache Superset</span> and
  <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Tableau</span> to develop interactive dashboards and perform statistical analyses.
  I'm also well-versed in version control through <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">GitHub</span> and comfortable
  with web technologies like <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">HTML</span> and <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">CSS</span>. 
  I am proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite for day-to-day business tasks as well.
  I have also taken a rigorous course in <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">C</span>, giving me strong fundamentals in low-level programming and
  memory management.</p>

    <h3>Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum</h3>
    <p>I am currently developing an interactive donor profiling dashboard in Apache Superset to visualize professional data
and support fundraising efforts through STATCOM (Statistics in the Community).</p>

    <h3>OptiLearn: An Interactive Educational Tool for Visualizing Optimization Algorithms</h3>
    <p>OptiLearn is an interactive web application designed to help students better understand optimization algorithms through visualization and hands-on exploration. Many optimization methods can feel abstract when learned only mathematically, so OptiLearn allows users to interact directly with algorithms by selecting methods, inputting their own functions or data, adjusting parameters, and stepping through each iteration. Animated plots and pseudocode views help bridge the gap between theory and intuition for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional optimization problems.<br><br>The application emphasizes dynamic visualization, robust input validation, and clear user feedback. Each algorithm iteration is precomputed and stored, enabling users to rewind or step forward through animations rendered with Plotly. Because the app is hosted on a serverless platform, all data parsing and interpolation are handled on the frontend, including both cubic spline and piecewise linear interpolation. OptiLearn was built with a strong focus on numerical stability, usability, and educational clarity, making it a practical learning tool for students studying optimization.</p>

    <h3>Investigating the Relationship Between Low Sleep and BMI</h3>
    <p>This project examined whether short sleep duration is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) among U.S. adults aged 20 and older. Using nationally representative, self-reported survey data, we conducted exploratory data analysis and multivariable regression modeling to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and BMI while adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and mental health covariates.<br><br>We identified a nonlinear (quadratic) relationship between sleep duration and BMI and implemented a piecewise modeling strategy, focusing on the effects of low sleep (<7 hours per night). Log-transforming BMI improved residual normality and model stability. Results indicated that low sleep was significantly associated with higher BMI (p = 0.006), even after controlling for physical activity, depression, and other covariates. Model diagnostics confirmed appropriate linearity, independence, and low multicollinearity.</p>

    <h3>Letterboxd Recommendation System</h3>
    <p>I completed a semester long project developing a movie recommendation system for Letterboxd, a social platform
      for film enthusiasts. The project explores three different approaches to creating better recommendations: Singular
      Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). SVD
      and NMF are matrix factorization techniques that work with explicit feedback (like ratings), while BPR is designed
      for implicit feedback (such as whether a user has watched a movie). The project also incorporates sentiment
      analysis of user reviews in an attempt to enhance recommendation accuracy. The final solution combines matrix
      factorization predictions with sentiment analysis results using a weighted approach, where the weight parameter β
      balances the influence of each method. The performance of these different approaches is evaluated using metrics
      like Precision@k, Reciprocal Rank, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to ensure the recommendations
      are both accurate and relevant to users' preferences.</p>
