    <div class="intro-content">
      <br>
      <p>I am a first year master's student in biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I completed my undergraduate 
        degree at Columbia Universtiy where I studied Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science 
        and discovered my passion for data analysis and statistics. I am grateful to be continuing my education at Michigan, 
        building my theoretical knowledge in statistics and applying my technical skills in real-world projects. I enjoy applying
        my analytical and collaborative skills to tackle interesting problems and am always eager to keep learning and improving.
        I am currently interested in computational statistics, AI/ML, Bayesian statistics, survival analysis, clinical trials, 
        and big data health analytics.
        Outside of academics, I enjoy running, true crime novels, live music, and podcasts!</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I have experience with several programming languages and tools, and I enjoy learning new ones.
  I have over two years of experience in <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Java</span> and <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Python</span>, including work with Python's <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Pandas</span> library for data
  manipulation and analysis. In data analysis, I have utilized <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">R</span>, <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">SAS</span>, <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Alteryx</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">SQL</span> to extract insights from complex
  datasets and create comprehensive reports. I have also worked with data visualization and analytics platforms such as <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Apache Superset</span> and
  <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">Tableau</span> to develop interactive dashboards and perform statistical analyses.
  I'm also well-versed in version control through <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">GitHub</span> and comfortable
  with web technologies like <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">HTML</span> and <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">CSS</span>. 
  I am proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite for day-to-day business tasks as well.
  I have also taken a rigorous course in <span style="color: rgb(100, 142, 197);">C</span>, giving me strong fundamentals in low-level programming and
  memory management.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum</h3>
    <p>I am currently developing an interactive donor profiling dashboard in Apache Superset to visualize professional data
and support fundraising efforts through STATCOM (Statistics in the Community).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Letterboxd Recommendation System</h3>
    <p>I completed a semester long project developing a movie recommendation system for Letterboxd, a social platform
      for film enthusiasts. The project explores three different approaches to creating better recommendations: Singular
      Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). SVD
      and NMF are matrix factorization techniques that work with explicit feedback (like ratings), while BPR is designed
      for implicit feedback (such as whether a user has watched a movie). The project also incorporates sentiment
      analysis of user reviews in an attempt to enhance recommendation accuracy. The final solution combines matrix
      factorization predictions with sentiment analysis results using a weighted approach, where the weight parameter β
      balances the influence of each method. The performance of these different approaches is evaluated using metrics
      like Precision@k, Reciprocal Rank, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to ensure the recommendations
      are both accurate and relevant to users' preferences.</p>

    <h3>Epidemiological Data Briefs</h3>
    <p>In my Data Science and Health Equity course, I created two Epidemiological Data Briefs. For each brief, I
      developed a research question, conducted background research, defined relevant variables, assessed survey data
      populations, and performed data analysis to present findings effectively.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>In Java, I built a program that identifies the most frequently used words in large text files, 
      which helped me strengthen my skills in file parsing and data structure use for word frequency analysis. 
      In C, I developed a multi-client chat server, demonstrating my understanding of network programming and socket-based 
      communication.</p>

      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <br>
      <p>In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work at United Wholesale Mortgage as an Automation Finance Intern. I
        worked on a project that involved planning, designing, building, testing, and monitoring an automated financial
        reporting system to improve efficiency and accuracy in data processing and analysis. My project is now live,
        running daily, and saving the company nearly 500 hours and $20,000 annually.</p>
