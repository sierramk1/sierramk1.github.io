         <div class="intro-content">
         <p>I am a senior at Columbia University studying Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for problem-solving and discovering structured methods for resolving challenges. Outside academics, I enjoy training for half marathons, true crime novels, the theater, live music, and podcasts!</p>

       <h3>Projects & Skills</h3>
       <br>
       <p>I have deep experience with several programming languages and tools, and I greatly enjoy learning new ones. I have over two years of experience in Java and Python, including  work with Python's PANDAS library for data manipulation and analysis. In data analysis, I have utilized R, Alteryx, and SQL to extract insights from complex datasets and create comprehensive reports. I'm also well-versed in version control through GitHub and comfortable with web technologies like HTML and CSS. I am proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite for day-to-day business tasks as well. I have also taken a rigorous course in C, giving me strong fundamentals in low-level programming and memory management.</p>
       <br>
       <p>I completed a semester long project developing a movie recommendation system for Letterboxd, a social platform for film enthusiasts. The project explores three different approaches to creating better recommendations: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). SVD and NMF are matrix factorization techniques that work with explicit feedback (like ratings), while BPR is designed for implicit feedback (such as whether a user has watched a movie). The project also incorporates sentiment analysis of user reviews in an attempt to enhance recommendation accuracy. The final solution combines matrix factorization predictions with sentiment analysis results using a weighted approach, where the weight parameter Î² balances the influence of each method. The performance of these different approaches is evaluated using metrics like Precision@k, Reciprocal Rank, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to ensure the recommendations are both accurate and relevant to users' preferences.</p>

       <br>
       <p>In my Data Science and Health Equity course, I created two Epidemiological Data Briefs. For each brief, I developed a research question, conducted background research, defined relevant variables, assessed survey data populations, and performed data analysis to present findings effectively.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Other past projects of mine in Java include a program I developed to identify the most frequently occurring word within extensive texts. Through this project, I acquired skills in parsing files and effectively utilized data structures to perform word frequency analysis. In C, I created a chat server to connect multiple clients. This project demonstrates my proficiency in network programming, as I created a platform for secure and seamless conversations using socket programming.</p>

       <h3>Work</h3>
       <br>
       <p>This past summer I had the opportunity to work at United Wholesale Mortgage as an Automation Finance Intern. I worked on a project that involved planning, designing, building, testing, and monitoring an automated financial reporting system to improve efficiency and accuracy in data processing and analysis. My project is now live, running daily, and saving the company nearly 500 hours and $20,000 annually.</p>
